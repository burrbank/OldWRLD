# Intro



## Premise

**Premise:** **BeyondSlick Media Corp** runs an augmented reality park. Something has gone wrong **BSMCorp** has put a call out for contractors to resolve the situation at the park. The park is located on a semi-terraformed planet (**FL-1944**) with 3 uninhabited moons orbiting a grey star. located less than **1 jump** away from some other point of interest (Space Highway, Gate, Prospero's Dream, etc.). The park is a simulacrum of late 1990s America before the Dark Ages II after Y2K.

The Problem is that a contingent of the park's attendees have discovered that the park is a simulacrum, before their scheduled end of **full immersion** in the park. The rebels are almost impossible to reason with as their perceptions have been significantly altered to block out most modern technology and are limited to only knowing that there is some sort of conspiracy to control them and the other park attendees. Up until recently rebellion activity was limited to vandalism, but has taken a violent turn killing 17 park attendees in a bombing attack.

**BSMCorp** is putting a bounty up for anyone who can flush out the rebellion threatening their tourist trap. **700 000 000 Credits** to resolve the situation. Subtracting the following fees (*only notified once the crew arrives on planet*)

* -**10 000 credits** per crew member for park access
* **-100 000 credits** for any killed attendee (including rogue attendees)
* **-20 credits / day** for O2
* equipment and gear can be purchased at a **4x markup** out of the pay all branded with the **BSMCorp Logo**
