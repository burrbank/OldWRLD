## Premise

**Premise:** **BeyondSlick Media Corp** runs an augmented reality park. Something has gone wrong **BSMCorp** has put a call out for contractors to resolve the situation at the park. The park is located on a semi-terraformed planet (**FL-1944**) with 3 uninhabited moons orbiting a grey star. located less than **1 jump** away from some other point of interest (Space Highway, Gate, Prospero's Dream, etc.). The park is a simulacrum of 90s America before the Dark Ages II after Y2K.

The Problem is that a contingent of the parks mind wiped attendees have discovered that the park is a simulacrum, before their end of vacation memory re-install. The rebels are almost impossible to reason with as their perceptions have been significantly altered to block out most modern technology and are limited to only knowing that there is some sort of conspiracy to control them and the other park attendees. Up until recently rebellious park activity was limited to vandalism but has taken a violent turn killing 17 park attendees in a bombing attack.
